# CycleJS on 2019

Just me trying new stuff in Cycle, my last attempt at this is on `js-fullstack`.

## Changelog

- Based upon `create-cycle-app`
- Modified it to my taste, (but keeping typescript this time for learning purposes)

## TODO

- Implement https://gitlab.com/staltz/ams Temperature component to learn about lenses.
